                        At the start of the of the training the staff conduct an orientation regarding about the training. As I observed all the staff are approachable. They guide us what to do. On the first day I am very thankful
because they give us the instructions on how to operate the computer, during hands on sometimes I do
not know how to operate, but the staff is willing to assist.

As we continue our training every saturday they introduce many activities for us to learned, like parts of the computer the input and output, hardware, software, windows, short keys, making pie graph, bar graph, line graph, power point presentation, web page. With all the knowledge of the IT staff I learned a lot from them.

To the NBSC IT staff I am very thankful for this opportunity for having this training it helps me a lot
especially for us teacher is. As my journey by teaching the ALS learners I can use what I have learned here,
I can share it to them.
